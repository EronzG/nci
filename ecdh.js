// Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman

// Alice and Bob

// Want to share communication securely

// to communicate, they must share a secret

// then use that secret to encrypt traffic

// secret is used an an encryption key (e.g. 32-byte string)

// key exchange

// challenge is doing a secure key exchange

// to exchange a secret, Alice and Bob must have public/private keypairs

// Alice knows Bob's public key

// Bob knows Alice's public key

// Signal Protocol - every communication uses a different encryption key, 
// that cannot be derived from the previous encryption key
